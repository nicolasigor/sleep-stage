# sleep-stage

This repository was made for the course EL7006 Neural Networks and Information Theory for Learning, Universidad de Chile, with educational purposes.

This is a toy example of sleep stage scoring with simple features and a Random Forest classifier, using sleep data from the MASS Database [1] (not included in this repository). Scripts of visualization and classification can be found inside the 'scripts' directory.  It is meant to be a working example for the input pipeline of the classification task needed for course projects.

Access to the database should be properly requested following the instructions at http://massdb.herokuapp.com/en/get-access/
